      question: "What is n8n and why do you use it for bot development?",
      answer: "n8n is a powerful workflow automation platform that allows us to create sophisticated, custom bots without the limitations of pre-built templates. It enables us to integrate with virtually any API, create complex decision trees, and build truly personalized automation flows that match your specific business needs."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to build and deploy a custom bot?",
      answer: "Most bots are completed within 5-7 business days after the discovery call. This includes custom design, testing, integration, and deployment. Enterprise solutions with multiple bots may take 2-3 weeks depending on complexity and integration requirements."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you provide ongoing support and optimization?",
      answer: "Absolutely! We provide comprehensive support packages ranging from 7 days for Starter Flow to 90 days white-glove support for Enterprise clients. This includes monitoring, optimization, troubleshooting, and regular performance reviews to ensure your bots continue performing at peak efficiency."
    },
    {
      question: "Can your bots integrate with my existing tools and platforms?",
      answer: "Yes! Our n8n-based bots can integrate with virtually any platform that has an API, including CRM systems, email marketing tools, e-commerce platforms, booking systems, and more. We ensure seamless integration with your existing tech stack."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes Aurum Flow different from other bot services?",
      answer: "We're intentionally private and selective with clients, ensuring personalized attention and custom-built solutions rather than resold templates. Every bot is tailored specifically for your business, built using enterprise-grade n8n platform, and comes with ongoing optimization and support."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a limit to how many messages the bots can handle?",
      answer: "Our bots are designed to handle high-volume messaging without limitations. They operate 24/7 and can process hundreds or thousands of interactions simultaneously, ensuring no lead or customer inquiry goes unanswered, even during peak traffic periods."
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of analytics and reporting do you provide?",
      answer: "We provide comprehensive analytics including response rates, conversion metrics, lead capture data, engagement patterns, and ROI tracking. Enterprise clients receive custom dashboards with real-time monitoring and detailed performance insights."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I make changes to the bot after it's deployed?",
      answer: "Yes! We include optimization sessions in our packages, and you can request modifications. Minor tweaks are often included in your support package, while major feature additions may require additional development time, which we'll discuss transparently."
